# Social-Media-Data-Analysis Suppose you work for a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. Your team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.  

They want you to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use your analysis to  making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results.

# In the process of analyzing the social media experiment data, I followed a systematic approach to generate, clean, and visualize the dataset. Initially, I created a Python data dictionary with random date, category, and likes data, ensuring alignment among the fields. Challenges arose when handling null data and duplicates, requiring the use of pandas' drop and deduplication methods. Converting the 'Date' field to a datetime format and the 'Likes' data to integers facilitated better data representation.

Visualization played a crucial role in understanding the dataset. Utilizing seaborn, I generated a histogram and boxplot for the 'Likes' field, providing insights into the distribution and variations among categories. Statistical analysis, such as calculating the mean likes, and exploring category-wise mean likes, added depth to the interpretation.

One key aspect that sets my portfolio project apart is the meticulous attention to data cleaning and visualization. The process was not just about running code; it involved critical thinking to ensure the dataset's integrity and meaningful representation. The use of seaborn for visualization added a professional touch to the project, making it more accessible and insightful.

For future improvements, considering a broader range of statistical analyses and incorporating more advanced visualization techniques could enhance the project. Additionally, providing a detailed narrative explaining the data patterns and trends would further elevate the project's storytelling aspect.

In my portfolio artifacts, I will include image files of the generated graphs, annotated excerpts from the code to explain its purpose, and reflections on potential improvements for future iterations. This project showcases my ability to navigate data processing challenges and communicate findings effectively, setting it apart as a comprehensive and insightful analysis in the realm of social media experiments.
